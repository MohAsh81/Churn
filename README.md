# Churn
This code predicts customer churn using a neural network. It loads and preprocesses a dataset, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes features. After splitting into training and testing sets, a Keras model is trained for 100 epochs. Predictions are made, and a confusion matrix visualizes the model's performance.
